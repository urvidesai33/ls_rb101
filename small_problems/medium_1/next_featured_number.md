A featured number (something unique to this exercise) is an odd number that is a multiple of 7, and whose digits occur exactly once each. So, for example, 49 is a featured number, but 98 is not (it is not odd), 97 is not (it is not a multiple of 7), and 133 is not (the digit 3 appears twice).

Write a method that takes a single integer as an argument, and returns the next featured number that is greater than the argument. Return an error message if there is no next featured number.
