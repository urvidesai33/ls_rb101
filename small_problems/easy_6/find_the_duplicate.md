Given an unordered array and the information that exactly one value in the array occurs twice (every other value occurs exactly once), how would you determine which value occurs twice? Write a method that will find and return the duplicate value that is known to be in the array.

Examples:
```ruby
find_dup([1, 5, 3, 1]) == 1
find_dup([18,  9, 36, 96, 31, 19, 54, 75, 42, 15,
          38, 25, 97, 92, 46, 69, 91, 59, 53, 27,
          14, 61, 90, 81,  8, 63, 95, 99, 30, 65,
          78, 76, 48, 16, 93, 77, 52, 49, 37, 29,
          89, 10, 84,  1, 47, 68, 12, 33, 86, 60,
          41, 44, 83, 35, 94, 73, 98,  3, 64, 82,
          55, 79, 80, 21, 39, 72, 13, 50,  6, 70,
          85, 87, 51, 17, 66, 20, 28, 26,  2, 22,
          40, 23, 71, 62, 73, 32, 43, 24,  4, 56,
          7,  34, 57, 74, 45, 11, 88, 67,  5, 58]) == 73
```

# Problem

Find and return the value in the array that occurs twice, when all other values occur only once.

Input: Array (unordered)
Ouptut: Element in array that occurs twice

Explicit Rules: All values in the array occur once except for one which occurs twice

# Examples
find_dup([1, 5, 3, 1]) == 1
find_dup([18,  9, 36, 96, 31, 19, 54, 75, 42, 15,
          38, 25, 97, 92, 46, 69, 91, 59, 53, 27,
          14, 61, 90, 81,  8, 63, 95, 99, 30, 65,
          78, 76, 48, 16, 93, 77, 52, 49, 37, 29,
          89, 10, 84,  1, 47, 68, 12, 33, 86, 60,
          41, 44, 83, 35, 94, 73, 98,  3, 64, 82,
          55, 79, 80, 21, 39, 72, 13, 50,  6, 70,
          85, 87, 51, 17, 66, 20, 28, 26,  2, 22,
          40, 23, 71, 62, 73, 32, 43, 24,  4, 56,
          7,  34, 57, 74, 45, 11, 88, 67,  5, 58]) == 73

START Method Definition find_dup(array)
  Iterate through the array one element at a time starting at Index 0
    Iterate through the array one element at a time starting at Index 0
      If element in loop 0 == element in loop 1 and indices are different then return the element
    End Loop
  End loop
End Method
